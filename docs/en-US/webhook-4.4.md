# Webhook (Zabbix 4.4 and higher)

In Zabbix 4.4 and higher, you have the option to use the built-in webhook media-type.

Go to the "Administration" -> "Media types" section and click "Import" to upload the media type:

![webhook-media-type-import](../../images/webhook/media-type-4.4-import.png)

Upload the [media type](../../webhook/media-type-4.4.xml) and leave the rest of the options as default.

Configure your Zabbix user according to the [instructions](user.md).
